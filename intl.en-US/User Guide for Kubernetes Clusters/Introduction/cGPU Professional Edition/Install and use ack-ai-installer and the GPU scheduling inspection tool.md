# Install and use ack-ai-installer and the GPU scheduling inspection tool

Container Service for Kubernetes \(ACK\) provides graphics processing unit \(GPU\) sharing based on cGPU. You can use cGPU to share one GPU in model inference scenarios. In addition, the NVIDIA kernel driver ensures that the GPU memory allocated to each container is isolated from the other containers. This topic describes how to install ack-ai-installer and the GPU scheduling inspection tool on a GPU-accelerated node. You can use them to implement GPU sharing and memory isolation.

-   A professional managed Kubernetes cluster is created. When you create the cluster, you must select the instance types for **heterogeneous computing**, including GPU-accelerated, FPGA-accelerated, and NPU-accelerated instances. For more information about other cluster parameters, see [Create a professional managed Kubernetes cluster](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Introduction/Create a professional managed Kubernetes cluster.md).

    **Note:** You can install ack-ai-installer in only professional managed Kubernetes clusters. To install ack-ai-installer in dedicated Kubernetes clusters, [Submit a ticket](https://workorder-intl.console.aliyun.com/console.htm) to add your account to the whitelist.

-   You can install ack-ai-installer on nodes that are deployed in all regions. However, only regions in the following table support GPU memory isolation. If you require GPU memory isolation, make sure that the region where your cluster is deployed is included in the following table.

    |Region|Region ID|

## Step 1: Install ack-ai-installer

1.  Log on to the [ACK console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the upper-right corner of the App Catalog page, enter ack-ai-installer into the search bar and click the search icon. Find and click **ack-ai-installer**.

3.  On the App Catalog - ack-ai-installer page, select a cluster in the Deploy section to deploy ack-ai-installer and click **Create**.

    After ack-ai-installer is installed, you are redirected to the details page of ack-ai-installer. You can view the plug-ins of ack-ai-installer.


## Step 2: Enable GPU sharing and memory isolation

1.  Log on to the [ACK console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**.

3.  On the Clusters page, find the cluster where ack-ai-installer is installed and click **Node Pools** in the **Actions** column.

4.  In the upper-right corner of the Node Pools page, click **Create Node Pool**.

5.  In the Create Node Pool dialog box, configure the node pool.

    For more information, see [Create a professional managed Kubernetes cluster](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Introduction/Create a professional managed Kubernetes cluster.md). The following list describes some of the parameters:

    -   Quantity: Specify the initial number of nodes in the node pool. If you do not need to create nodes in the node pool, set this parameter to 0.
    -   Operating System: Select an operating system for the nodes. Supported operating systems are CentOS, Aliyun Cloud Linux 2.x, and Windows.
    -   ECS Label: You can add labels to the ECS instances.
    -   Custom Resource Group: You can specify the resource group to which the nodes in the node pool belong.
    -   Node Label: You can add labels to the nodes. For more information about node labels, see [t1998127.md\#]().
        -   Enable both GPU sharing and memory isolation.

            Click ![Node Label](../images/p183919.png) on the right side of **Node Label**. Set **Key** to ack.node.gpu.schedule and set **Value** to cgpu.

            **Note:** If you want to enable only GPU sharing for the node pool, set **Key** to ack.node.gpu.schedule and set **Value** to share for **Node Label**.

        -   Use the binpack algorithm to allocate GPUs to pods.

            Click ![Node Label](../images/p183919.png) on the right side of **Node Label**. Set **Key** to ack.node.gpu.placement and set **Value** to binpack.

6.  Click **Confirm Order**.


## Step 3: Add GPU-accelerated nodes

After the node pool is created, you can add GPU-accelerated nodes to the node pool. When you add GPU-accelerated nodes, you must select the instance types for **heterogeneous computing**, including GPU-accelerated, FPGA-accelerated, and NPU-accelerated instances. For more information, see [Add existing ECS instances to an ACK cluster](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Node management/Add existing ECS instances to an ACK cluster.md) or [Scale out a node pool](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Node management/Node pool management/Scale out a node pool.md).

**Note:** If you have already added GPU-accelerated nodes to the node pool when you create the node pool, skip this step.

## Step 4 \(optional\): Install and use the GPU scheduling inspection tool

1.  Configure the kubeconfig file. For more information, see [Use kubectl to connect to an ACK cluster](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Cluster management/Access clusters/Use kubectl to connect to an ACK cluster.md).

2.  Download kubectl-inspect-cgpu.

    -   If you use Linux, run the following command to download kubectl-inspect-cgpu:

        ```
        wget http://aliacs-k8s-cn-beijing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/gpushare/kubectl-inspect-cgpu-linux -O /usr/local/bin/kubectl-inspect-cgpu
        ```

    -   If you use macOS, run the following command to download kubectl-inspect-cgpu:

        ```
        wget http://aliacs-k8s-cn-beijing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/gpushare/kubectl-inspect-cgpu-darwin -O /usr/local/bin/kubectl-inspect-cgpu
        ```

3.  Run the following command to make kubectl-inspect-cgpu executable:

    ```
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/kubectl-inspect-cgpu
    ```

4.  Run the following command to query GPU usage in the cluster:

    ```
    kubectl inspect cgpu
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```
    NAME                       IPADDRESS      GPU0(Allocated/Total)  GPU Memory(GiB)
    cn-shanghai.192.168.6.104  192.168.6.104  0/15                   0/15
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Allocated/Total GPU Memory In Cluster:
    0/15 (0%)
    ```
