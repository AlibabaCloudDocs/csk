# Overview of observability

Observability is the ability to infer internal states of a system based on external outputs of the system. The observability of Kubernetes includes monitoring and logging. Monitoring allows developers to keep track of the operation of a system and logging facilitates diagnostics and troubleshooting. This topic provides insights to the observability of Container Service of Kubernetes \(ACK\) and the observability of each layer. This helps you gain a comprehensive understanding of observability.

## Observability of ACK

The observability of a system architecture that is built on top of ACK can be achieved at four layers. The four layers from bottom to top are: infrastructure, container performance, application performance, and business.

The following section describes the observability of each layer.
