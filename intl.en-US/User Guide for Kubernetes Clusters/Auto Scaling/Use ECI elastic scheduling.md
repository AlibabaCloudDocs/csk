# Use ECI elastic scheduling

Elastic Container Instance \(ECI\) elastic scheduling is an elastic scheduling strategy provided by Alibaba Cloud. You can add annotations to specify the resources that you want to use when you deploy applications. You can use only Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) instances or elastic container instances, or automatically request elastic container instances when ECS resources are insufficient. ECI elastic scheduling can meet your resource requirements in different workload scenarios.
