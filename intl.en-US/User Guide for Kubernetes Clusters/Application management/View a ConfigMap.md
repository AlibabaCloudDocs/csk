# View a ConfigMap

This topic describes how to view a ConfigMap in the Container Service for Kubernetes \(ACK\) console.

-   An ACK cluster is created. For more information, see [Create a managed Kubernetes cluster](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Cluster/Create Kubernetes clusters/Create a managed Kubernetes cluster.md).
-   A ConfigMap is created. For more information, see [Create a ConfigMap](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Serverless Kubernetes Clusters/ConfigMaps and Secrets/Create a ConfigMap.md).

1.  Log on to the [ACK console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane of the ACK console, click **Clusters**.

3.  On the Clusters page, find the cluster that you want to manage and click the name of the cluster or click **Details** in the **Actions** column. The details page of the cluster appears.

4.  In the left-side navigation pane of the details page, choose **Configurations** \> **ConfigMaps**.

5.  Select the cluster and namespace where the ConfigMap is stored. Find and click the name of the **ConfigMap** that you want to view.

6.  On the details page of the ConfigMap, you can view details about the ConfigMap. You can also view the key-value pairs in the ConfigMap.
