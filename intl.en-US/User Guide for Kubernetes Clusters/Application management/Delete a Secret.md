# Delete a Secret

This topic describes how to delete a Secret in the Container Service for Kubernetes \(ACK\) console.

-   An ACK cluster is created. For more information, see [Create a managed Kubernetes cluster](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Cluster/Create Kubernetes clusters/Create a managed Kubernetes cluster.md).
-   A Secret is created in the cluster. For more information, see [t16704.md\#](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Application management/Configuration items and key/Create a Secret.md).

**Note:** Do not delete Secrets that are created together with the cluster.

1.  Log on to the [ACK console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane of the ACK console, click **Clusters**.

3.  On the Clusters page, find the cluster that you want to manage and click the name of the cluster or click **Details** in the **Actions** column. The details page of the cluster appears.

4.  In the left-side navigation pane of the details page, choose **Configurations** \> **ConfigMaps**.

5.  Click the **Secrets** tab, find the Secret that you want to delete and click **Delete** in the Actions column. In the message that appears, click **OK**.
