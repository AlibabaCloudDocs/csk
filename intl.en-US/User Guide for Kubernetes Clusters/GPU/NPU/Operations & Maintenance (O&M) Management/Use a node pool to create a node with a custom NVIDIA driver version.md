# Use a node pool to create a node with a custom NVIDIA driver version

By default, Container Service for Kubernetes \(ACK\) are installed with the NVIDIA driver of version 418.87.01. If your CUDA Toolkit requires a higher version of the NVIDIA driver, you must specify a custom NVIDIA driver version. This topic describes how to use a node pool to create a node with a custom NVIDIA driver version.

## Benefits

This solution allows you to manage the NVIDIA drivers of different nodes in batches. The following two scenarios are covered:

-   Node Pool A consists of all nodes on which you want to install the NVIDIA driver of version 418.181.07. If you want to schedule a task to a node that runs the NVIDIA driver of version 418.181.07, you need only to set the **selector** of the task to the label of Node Pool A.
-   You manage cluster nodes in two groups: A and B. You want to install the NVIDIA driver of version 418.181.07 in Group A and the NVIDIA driver of version 450.102.0 in Group B. In this case, you can add nodes in Group A to Node Pool A and nodes in Group B to Node Pool B.

## Step 2: Create a node pool and specify the NVIDIA driver version

**Method 1: Select an NVIDIA driver version provided by ACK**

The following example shows how to set the NVIDIA driver version to 418.181.07:

1.  Log on to the [ACK console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**.

3.  On the Clusters page, find the cluster that you want to manage and click the name of the cluster or click **Details** in the **Actions** column. The details page of the cluster appears.

4.  In the left-side navigation pane of the details page, choose **Nodes** \> **Node Pools**.

5.  Click **Create Node Pool** in the upper-right corner.

6.  In the **Create Node Pool** dialog box, configure the parameters based on your requirements. For more information about the parameters, see [Create a dedicated Kubernetes cluster](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Cluster/Create Kubernetes clusters/Create a dedicated Kubernetes cluster.md). The following table describes the parameters:

    1.  Click **Show Advanced Options**.

    2.  In the **Node Label** section, click ![1](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/5146487161/p245638.png), set **Key** to `ack.aliyun.com/nvidia-driver-version`, and set **Value** to `418.181.07`.

        ACK provides the following NVIDIA driver versions:

        -   418.181.07
        -   450.102.04
        -   460.32.03
    3.  Click **Confirm Order**.


**Method 2: Use a custom NVIDIA driver version**

**Custom driver version**

The following example shows how to upload the NVIDIA-Linux-x86\_64-460.32.03.run driver to specify a custom driver version. You can download NVIDIA drivers from the [NVIDIA official website](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us).

**Note:** The NVIDIA-Linux-x86\_64-460.32.03.run file must be stored in the root directory of the Object Storage Service \(OSS\) bucket.

1.  Create a bucket in the OSS console. For more information, see [Create buckets](/intl.en-US/Console User Guide/Manage buckets/Create buckets.md).

2.  Upload the NVIDIA-Linux-x86\_64-460.32.03.run file to the bucket. For more information, see [Upload objects](/intl.en-US/Console User Guide/Upload, download, and manage objects/Upload objects.md).

3.  In the OSS console, select the NVIDIA driver file and click **View Details** in the **Actions** column.

4.  In the **Details** panel, click **HTTPS**![gpu-1](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/5146487161/p246955.png) to disable HTTPS configuration.

    **Note:** ACK downloads the driver file by using its URL, which adopts the HTTP protocol. By default, OSS uses the HTTPS protocol. You must click **HTTPS** to disable HTTPS configuration.

5.  Check the URL of the driver file. Take note of the URL. The URL consists of the following parts: endpoint and runfile. For example, you can divide the following URL into two parts: `[http://nvidia-XXX-XXX-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/NVIDIA-Linux-x86\_64-460.32.03.run](http://nvidia-XXX-XXX-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-460.32.03.run)`.

    -   endpoint: nvidia-XXX-XXX-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com
    -   runfile: NVIDIA-Linux-x86\_64-460.32.03.run

**Create a node pool with the custom driver version**

1.  Log on to the [ACK console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**.

3.  On the Clusters page, find the cluster that you want to manage and click the name of the cluster or click **Details** in the **Actions** column. The details page of the cluster appears.

4.  In the left-side navigation pane of the details page, choose **Nodes** \> **Node Pools**.

5.  Click **Create Node Pool** in the upper-right corner.

6.  In the **Create Node Pool** dialog box, configure the parameters based on your requirements. For more information about the parameters, see [Create a dedicated Kubernetes cluster](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Cluster/Create Kubernetes clusters/Create a dedicated Kubernetes cluster.md). The following table describes the parameters:

    1.  Click **Show Advanced Options**.

    2.  In the **Node Label** section, click ![1](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/5146487161/p245638.png) twice to add the following two labels:

        -   For the first label, set **Key** to `ack.aliyun.com/nvidia-driver-oss-endpoint` and **Value** to `nvidia-XXX-XXX-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com`.
        -   For the second label, set **Key** to `ack.aliyun.com/nvidia-driver-runfile` and **Value** to `NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-460.32.03.run`.

## Step 3: Check whether the custom NVIDIA driver version is installed

1.  In the ACK console, select the cluster to which the node belongs and click **More** \> **Open Cloud Shell** in the **Actions** column.

2.  Run the following command to query pods that have the `component: nvidia-device-plugin` label:

    ```
    kubectl get po -n kube-system -l component=nvidia-device-plugin -o wide
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```
    NAME                                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP              NODE                       NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
    nvidia-device-plugin-cn-beijing.192.168.1.127   1/1     Running   0          6d    192.168.1.127   cn-beijing.192.168.1.127   <none>           <none>
    nvidia-device-plugin-cn-beijing.192.168.1.128   1/1     Running   0          17m   192.168.1.128   cn-beijing.192.168.1.128   <none>           <none>
    nvidia-device-plugin-cn-beijing.192.168.8.12    1/1     Running   0          9d    192.168.8.12    cn-beijing.192.168.8.12    <none>           <none>
    nvidia-device-plugin-cn-beijing.192.168.8.13    1/1     Running   0          9d    192.168.8.13    cn-beijing.192.168.8.13    <none>           <none>
    nvidia-device-plugin-cn-beijing.192.168.8.14    1/1     Running   0          9d    192.168.8.14    cn-beijing.192.168.8.14    <none>           <none>
    ```

    You can refer to the Node column to find the node that is newly added to the cluster. The name of the pod that runs on the node is nvidia-device-plugin-cn-beijing.192.168.1.128.

3.  Run the following command to query the NVIDIA driver version of the node:

    ```
    kubectl exec -ti nvidia-device-plugin-cn-beijing.192.168.1.128 -n kube-system -- nvidia-smi 
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```
