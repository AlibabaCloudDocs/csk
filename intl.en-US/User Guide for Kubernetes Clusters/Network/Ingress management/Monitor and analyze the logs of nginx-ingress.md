# Monitor and analyze the logs of nginx-ingress

Container Service for Kubernetes \(ACK\) allows you to configure the nginx-ingress component for an ACK cluster. This component provides URLs that can be visited by servers outside the cluster, server load balancing, SSL termination, and name-based virtual hosting. You can also use nginx-ingress to write the logs of HTTP requests to the stdout file. ACK is also integrated with Log Service. This allows you to create dashboards to monitor and analyze the nginx-ingress logs with simple steps.

1.  The alibaba-log-controller component is installed.

    By default, alibaba-log-controller is installed when you create a cluster. If this component is not installed, you can manually install it. For more information, see [Collect log files from containers by using Log Service](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Observability/Log management/Collect log files from containers by using Log Service.md).

2.  The alibaba-log-controller component is updated.

    You can use one of the following methods to update alibaba-log-controller:

    -   Run the `kubectl edit deployment alibaba-log-controller -n kube-system` command.
    -   Update alibaba-log-controller in the ACK console.
        1.  Log on to the [ACK console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com).
        2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**.
        3.  On the **Clusters** page, click the name of the cluster that you want to manage, or click **Details** in the **Actions** column.
        4.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Workloads**.
        5.  On the **Deployments** tab, select the namespace **kube-system** of the cluster, click Edit in the Actions column of **alibaba-log-controller**, modify the configurations, and then click Update.

**Note:**

To update alibaba-log-controller in the kube-system namespace of the cluster that you want to manage, set the following parameters based on your needs:

-   Image Name: Set the image name in the format of registry-vpc.\{region-id\}.aliyuncs.com/acs/log-controller. Replace `{region-id}` with the ID of the region where the cluster is deployed. For example, cn-hangzhou, cn-beijing, or ap-southeast-1 can be specified.
-   Image Version: Use version 0.2.0.0-7f4d3bb-aliyun or later.

## Create a custom resource to collect the logs of nginx-ingress

You can create a custom resource for alibaba-log-controller to collect the logs of nginx-ingress. You can use one of the following methods to create a custom resource:

-   Run the kubectl command to write the following content to the nginx-ingress.yaml file.

    ```
    apiVersion: log.alibabacloud.com/v1alpha1
    kind: AliyunLogConfig
    metadata:
      # your config name, must be unique in you k8s cluster
      name: k8s-nginx-ingress
    spec:
      # logstore name to upload log
      logstore: nginx-ingress
      # product code, only for k8s nginx ingress
      productCode: k8s-nginx-ingress
      # logtail config detail
      logtailConfig:
        inputType: plugin
        # logtail config name, should be same with [metadata.name]
        configName: k8s-nginx-ingress
        inputDetail:
          plugin:
            inputs:
            - type: service_docker_stdout
              detail:
                IncludeLabel:
                  io.kubernetes.container.name: nginx-ingress-controller
                Stderr: false
                Stdout: true
            processors:
            - type: processor_regex
              detail:
                KeepSource: false
                Keys:
                - client_ip
                - x_forward_for
                - remote_user
                - time
                - method
                - url
                - version

                - http_referer
                - http_user_agent
                - request_length
                - request_time
                - proxy_upstream_name
                - upstream_addr
                - upstream_response_length
                - upstream_response_time
                - upstream_status
                - req_id
                - host
                - proxy_alternative_upstream_name
                NoKeyError: true
                NoMatchError: true
                Regex: ^(\S+)\s-\s\[([^]]+)]\s-\s(\S+)\s\[(\S+)\s\S+\s"(\w+)\s(\S+)\s([^"]+)"\s(\d+)\s(\d+)\s"([^"]*)"\s"([^"]*)"\s(\S+)\s(\S+)+\s\[([^]]*)]\s(\S+)\s(\S+)\s(\S+)\s(\S+)\s(\S+)\s*(\S*)\s*\[*([^]]*)\]*. *
                SourceKey: content
    ```

    Run the kubectl apply -f nginx-ingress.yaml command to create the nginx-ingress.yaml custom resource.

-   Use an orchestration template to create a custom resource.
    1.  Log on to the [ACK console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com).
    2.  Write the nginx-ingress.yaml file to an orchestration template.

        For more information about how to create an orchestration template, see [Create an orchestration template](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Application marketplace/Template management/Create an orchestration template.md).

    3.  Use the orchestration template to create an application. Select the default **namespace** of the cluster when you create the application.

**Note:**

-   Make sure that the version of alibaba-log-controller is `0.2.0.0-76648ee-aliyun` or later. After you update alibaba-log-controller, delete the custom resource and recreate it.
-   The custom resource that you create applies to only nginx-ingress. If the Ingress controller of your cluster is not nginx-ingress, modify the `processor_regex` field based on your needs in the nginx-ingress.yaml file. For more information, see [Use CRDs to collect Kubernetes container logs in DaemonSet mode](/intl.en-US/Data Collection/Logtail collection/Container log collection/Use CRDs to collect Kubernetes container logs in DaemonSet mode.md).
