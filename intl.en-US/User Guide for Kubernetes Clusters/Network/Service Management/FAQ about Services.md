## Why is the event of a Service synchronizing with the SLB instance not collected?

If the event is not collected after you run the `kubectl -n {your-namespace} describe SVC {your-svc-name}` command, verify that your CCM version is **v1.9.3.276-g372aa98-aliyun** or later. If your CCM version is earlier than **v1.9.3.276-g372aa98-aliyun**, the event of a Service synchronizing with the SLB instance is not collected. For more information about how to view and upgrade your CCM version, see [Manually upgrade the CCM](/intl.en-US/Bulletin/CCM upgrade notice.md).

If your CCM version is **v1.9.3.276-g372aa98-aliyun** or later, see [Submit a ticket](https://workorder-intl.console.aliyun.com/console.htm).

## How do I handle an SLB instance that remains in the Pending state?

1.  Run the `kubectl -n {your-namespace} describe svc {your-svc-name}` command to view the events.

2.  Troubleshoot the errors that are reported in the events. For more information about how to troubleshoot errors that are reported in the events, see [Errors that are reported in the events and how to troubleshoot them](#section_kr4_89m_2dh).

    If no errors are reported in the events, see [Why is the event of a Service synchronizing with the SLB instance not collected](#section_690_vh0_1lt).


## What do I do if the vServer groups of an SLB instance are not upgraded?

1.  Run the `kubectl -n {your-namespace} describe svc {your-svc-name}` command to view the events.

2.  Troubleshoot the errors that are reported in the events. For more information about how to troubleshoot errors that are reported in the events, see [Why is the event of a Service synchronizing with the SLB instance not collected](#section_kr4_89m_2dh).

    If no errors are reported in the events, see [Why is the event of a Service synchronizing with the SLB instance not collected](#section_690_vh0_1lt).


## What do I do if the annotations of a Service do not take effect?

1.  View the errors by performing the following steps:

    1.  Run the `kubectl -n {your-namespace} describe svc {your-svc-name}` command to view the events.

    2.  Troubleshoot the errors that are reported in the events. For more information about how to troubleshoot errors that are reported in the events, see [Why is the event of a Service synchronizing with the SLB instance not collected](#section_kr4_89m_2dh).

2.  If no errors are reported, you can deal with the issue based on the following scenarios:

    -   Make sure that your CCM version meets the requirements of the annotations. For more information about the correlation between the annotations and the CCM version, see [Common annotations](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Network/Service Management/Use annotations to configure load balancing.md).
    -   On the Services page, find the Service that you want to manage and click **View in YAML** in the **Actions** column. In the panel that appears, check whether the Service is configured with annotations. If the Service is not configured with annotations, you must configure annotations for the Service.

        For more information about how to configure annotations, see [Use annotations to configure load balancing](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Network/Service Management/Use annotations to configure load balancing.md).

        For more information about how to view the list of Services, see [Manage Services](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Network/Service Management/Manage Services.md).

    -   Verify that the values of the annotations are valid.

## Why is the configuration of an SLB instance modified?

When specific conditions are met, CCM calls a declarative API to automatically update the configuration of an SLB instance based on the Service configuration. If you modify the configurations of an SLB instance in the SLB console, CCM may overwrite the configurations. We recommend that you configure an SLB instance by using annotations. For more information about how to configure annotations for an SLB instance, see [Use annotations to configure load balancing](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Network/Service Management/Use annotations to configure load balancing.md).

**Note:** If the SLB instance is created and managed by CCM, we recommend that you do not modify the configuration of the SLB instance in the SLB console. Otherwise, CCM may overwrite the configuration and the Service may be unavailable.

## Why does the system fail to use an existing SLB instance for more than one Services?

-   Check the version of CCM. If the version is earlier than v1.9.3.105-gfd4e547-aliyun, CCM cannot use existing SLB instances for more than one Services. For more information about how to view and upgrade your CCM version, see [Manually upgrade the CCM](/intl.en-US/Bulletin/CCM upgrade notice.md).
-   Check whether the reused SLB instance is created by the cluster. The SLB instance cannot be reused if it is created by the cluster.
-   Check whether the SLB instance is used by the API server. The SLB instance cannot be reused if it is used by the API server.
-   If the reused SLB instance is an internal-facing SLB instance, check whether the instance and the cluster are deployed in the same virtual private cloud \(VPC\). The SLB instance cannot be reused if they are deployed in different VPCs.

## Why is no listener created when I reuse an existing SLB instance?

Make sure that you set `service.beta.kubernetes.io/alibaba-cloud-loadbalancer-force-override-listeners` to `true` in the annotation. If you do not set the value to true, no listener is created.

**Note:** The following list explains why CCM does not overwrite listeners of an existing SLB instance:

-   If you overwrite the listeners of an existing SLB instance that distributes network traffic to a Service, a Service interruption may occur.
-   CCM supports limited backend configurations and cannot handle complex configurations. If the vServer group requires complex configurations, you can manually create listeners in the SLB console instead of overwriting the existing listeners.

In both cases, we recommend that you do not overwrite the listeners of existing SLB instances. However, you can overwrite an existing listener if the port of the listener is no longer in use.

## What do I do if CCM fails to upgrade?

For more information about solutions to CCM upgrade failures, see [CCM upgrade failures](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/164988.htm).

## Why does the cluster fail to access the IP address of the SLB instance?

For more information about why does cluster fail to access the IP address of the SLB instance, see [Kubernetes clusters cannot access the IP address of the SLB instance](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/171437.htm).

## Is the corresponding SLB instance deleted after I delete a Service?

If the SLB instance is reused, it is not deleted together with the Service. If the SLB instance is not reused, it is deleted. If a Service contains the `service.beta.kubernetes.io/alibaba-cloud-loadbalancer-id: {your-slb-id}` annotation, the corresponding SLB instance is reused.

If you change the type of the Service, for example, from LoadBalancer to NodePort, the corresponding SLB instance is also deleted.

## What do I do if I accidentally delete an SLB instance?

-   **Scenario 1: What do I do if I accidentally delete the SLB instance of the API server?**

    The deleted SLB instance cannot be restored. You must create a new SLB instance.

-   **Scenario 2: What do I do if I delete the SLB instance of an Ingress?**

    Perform the following steps to recreate the SLB instance:

    1.  Log on to the [the ACK console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com).
    2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**.
    3.  On the Clusters page, find the cluster that you want to manage. Then, click the name of the cluster or click **Details** in the **Actions** column.
    4.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Services and Ingresses** \> **Services**.
    5.  On the top of the Services page, select **kube-system** from the **Namespace** drop-down list. Then, find **nginx-ingress-lb** on the list of Services and click **View in YAML** in the **Actions** column.

        If you cannot find **nginx-ingress-lb** on the lists of Services, use the following template to create a Service named **nginx-ingress-lb**:

        ```
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Service
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: nginx-ingress-lb
          name: nginx-ingress-lb
          namespace: kube-system
        spec:
          externalTrafficPolicy: Local
          ports:
          - name: http
            port: 80
            protocol: TCP
            targetPort: 80
          - name: https
            port: 443
            protocol: TCP
            targetPort: 443
          selector:
            app: ingress-nginx
          type: LoadBalancer
        ```

    6.  In the Edit YAML dialog box, remove the content in the **status** field. Then, click **Update** to set CCM to create an SLB instance.
-   **Scenario 3: What do I do if I delete an SLB instance that is configured to handle workloads?**
    -   If you do not need the Service that is associated with the SLB instance, delete the Service.
    -   If you want to keep the Service, perform the following steps:
        1.  Log on to the [the ACK console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com).
        2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**.
        3.  On the Clusters page, find the cluster that you want to manage. Then, click the name of the cluster or click **Details** in the **Actions** column.
        4.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Services and Ingresses** \> **Services**.
        5.  On the top of the Services page, select **All Namespaces** from the **Namespace** drop-down list. Then, find the Service in the list of Services and click **View in YAML** in the **Actions** column.
        6.  In the Edit YAML dialog box, remove the content in the **status** field. Then, click **Update** to set CCM to create an SLB instance.

## How do I connect CCM to a Kubernetes cluster that is created on top of Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\)?

For more information about how to connect CCM to a Kubernetes cluster that is created on top of ECS, see [kubernetes / cloud-provider-alibaba-cloud](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-alibaba-cloud/) and [cloud-provider-alibaba-cloud/docs/getting-started.md](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-alibaba-cloud/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md).

## How do I rename an SLB instance when the CCM version is V1.9.3.10 or earlier?

For CCM versions later than V1.9.3.10, the tag is automatically added to the SLB instances in the cluster. You need only to change the value if you want to rename an SLB instance. For CCM V1.9.3.10 and earlier, you must manually add a specific tag to an SLB instance if you want to rename the SLB instance. Perform the following steps to rename an SLB instance:

**Note:**

-   You can rename an SLB instance by adding tags to the instance only if the CCM version is V1.9.3.10 or earlier.
-   The Service type is LoadBalancer.

1.  Log on to a master node in an ACK cluster. For more information, see [Use kubectl to connect to an ACK cluster](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Cluster/Access clusters/Use kubectl to connect to an ACK cluster.md).

2.  Run the `# kubectl get svc -n ${namespace} ${service}` command to view the Service type and IP address of the Service.

    ![Service type](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/3545359951/p44550.png)

    **Note:** Replace $\{namespace\} and $\{service\} with the cluster namespace and the Service name separately.

3.  Run the following command to create the tag that you want to add to the SLB instance:

    ```
    kubectl get svc -n ${namespace} ${service} -o jsonpath="{.metadata.uid}"|awk -F "-" '{print "kubernetes.do.not.delete: "substr("a"$1$2$3$4$5,1,32)}'
    ```

    ![tag](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/3545359951/p44551.png)

4.  Log on to the [SLB console](https://slb.console.aliyun.com), select the region where the SLB instance is deployed, and then use the IP address that is returned in Step 2 to find the specified SLB instance.

5.  Add the tag that is generated in Step 3 to the SLB instance. Callout 1 in the preceding figure is the tag key, and callout 2 is the tag value. For more information, see [Add a tag](/intl.en-US/Classic Load Balancer/User Guide/Instance/Tags/Tag overview.md).


## How does CCM calculate node weights in Local mode?

In this example, pods with the app=nginx label are deployed on three ECS instances. In the following figure, when externalTrafficPolicy is set to Local, the pods provide services for external users by using Service A. The following sections describe how node weights are calculated.

![CCM2](../images/p103113.png "")

-   **For CCM V1.9.3.164-g2105d2e-aliyun and later**

    For CCM versions that are earlier than V1.9.3.164-g2105d2e-aliyun, the following figure shows that the weight of each ECS instance in Local mode is 100. This indicates that traffic loads are evenly distributed to the ECS instances. However, the loads of the pods are different because the pods are unevenly deployed on the ECS instances. For example, the pod on ECS 1 takes the heaviest load and the pods on ECS 3 take the lightest load.

    ![CCM3](../images/p103116.png "")

-   **For CCM versions that are later than V1.9.3.164-g2105d2e-aliyun but earlier than V1.9.3.276-g372aa98-aliyun**

    For CCM versions that are later than V1.9.3.164-g2105d2e-aliyun but earlier than V1.9.3.276-g372aa98-aliyun, the node weights are calculated based on the number of pods deployed on each node, as shown in the following figure. The weights of the ECS instances are 16, 33, and 50 based on this calculation. Therefore, traffic loads are distributed to the ECS instances at the ratio of 1:2:3.

    Calculation formula:

    ![Formula](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/4545359951/p103112.png)

    ![ccm4](../images/p103117.png "")

-   **For CCM V1.9.3.276-g372aa98-aliyun and later**

    The weight calculation in the preceding figure still has a slight imbalance due to the precision of the calculation formula. For CCM V1.9.3.276-g372aa98-aliyun and later, the weight of each node equals the number of pods deployed on the node. In the following figure, the weights of the ECS instances are 1, 2, and 3. Traffic loads are distributed to the ECS instances at the ratio of 1:2:3. This way, the pods have a more balanced load than the pods in the preceding figure.

    Calculation formula:

    ![Node weight](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/4545359951/p118174.png)

    ![node](../images/p118175.png "")


## Error messages reported for Services and solutions

The following table lists solutions to error messages reported for Services.

|Error message|Description and solution|
|-------------|------------------------|
|The backend server number has reached to the quota limit of this load balancers|Indicates that the vServer group quota of the SLB instance is insufficient.

We recommend that you set the externalTrafficPolicy of the SLB instance to Local \(`externalTrafficPolicy: Local`\), because the quota of vServer groups is consumed quickly in Cluster mode. If you set the externalTrafficPolicy of the SLB instance to Cluster, specify vServers by adding tags. For more information about how to add tags in annotations to associate with vServers, see [Use annotations to configure load balancing](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Network/Service Management/Use annotations to configure load balancing.md). |
|The backend server number has reached to the quota limit of this load balancer|The number of vServers of the SLB instance has reached the upper limit. If the SLB instance is shared by multiple Services, the vServers used by these Services are summed up. We recommend that you create a new SLB instance when you create a Service.|
|The loadbalancer does not support backend servers of eni type|Shared-resource SLB instances do not support elastic network interfaces \(ENIs\). If you want to specify an ENI as a backend server, the SLB instance that you create must be a high-performance SLB instance. Add the `annotation: service.beta.kubernetes.io/alibaba-cloud-loadbalancer-spec: "slb.s1.small"` annotation to the Service. **Note:** Make sure that the annotations that you add meet the requirements of the CCM version. For more information about the correlation between the annotations and the CCM version, see [Common annotations](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Network/Service Management/Use annotations to configure load balancing.md). |
|alicloud: not able to find loadbalancer named \[%s\] in openapi, but it's defined in service.loaderbalancer.ingress. this may happen when you removed loadbalancerid annotation|The system fails to associate a Service with the SLB instance.

-   Check whether the SLB instance exists. If the SLB instance does not exist and the Service is not used, delete the Service.
-   If the SLB instance exists, perform the following steps:
    1.  Check whether the SLB instance is manually created in the SLB console. If the SLB instance is manually created in the SLB console, reuse the SLB instance by adding the relevant annotation to it. For more information, see [Use annotations to configure load balancing](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Network/Service Management/Use annotations to configure load balancing.md).
    2.  If the SLB instance is automatically created in ACK, check whether the **kubernetes.do.not.delete** label is added to the SLB instance. If the label is not added to the SLB instance, see [t1227076.md\#section\_30n\_419\_ho6](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Network/FAQ about network management.md). |
|ORDER.ARREARAGE Message: The account is arrearage.|You have overdue payments.|
|Status Code: 400 Code: Throttlingxxx|A large number of API operations are called. API throttling is triggered.|
|Status Code: 400 Code: RspoolVipExist Message: there are vips associating with this vServer group.|The listener that is associated with the vServer group cannot be deleted. Solution:

1.  Check whether the annotation of the Service contains the ID of the SLB instance, for example, `service.beta.kubernetes.io/alibaba-cloud-loadbalancer-id: {your-slb-id}`.'

If the annotation of the Service contains the ID of the SLB instance, it indicates that the SLB instance is reused.

2.  Log on to the SLB console and delete the listener that uses the Service port. For more information about how to delete listeners for an SLB instance, see [Manage forwarding rules for listeners](/intl.en-US/Application Load Balancer/ALB User Guide/Listeners/Manage forwarding rules for listeners.md). |
|Status Code: 400 Code: NetworkConflict|When I reuse an internal-facing SLB instance, the SLB instance and the cluster are not in the same VPC. You must ensure that your SLB instance and the cluster are in the same VPC.|
|Status Code: 400 Code: VSwitchAvailableIpNotExist Message: The specified VSwitch has no available ip.|The idle IP addresses in the current vSwitch is insufficient. You can specify another vSwitch in the same VPC by using `service.beta.kubernetes.io/alibaba-cloud-loadbalancer-vswitch-id: "${YOUR_VSWITCH_ID}"`.|
|PAY.INSUFFICIENT\_BALANCE Message: Your account does not have enough balance.|The balance in your account is less than CNY 100.|
|The specified Port must be between 1 and 65535.|`targetPort` of the STRING type is not supported in ENI mode. Set the `targetPort` field in the Service YAML to an INTEGER value.|
|Status Code: 400 Code: ShareSlbHaltSales Message: The share instance has been discontinued.|Shared-resource SLB instances are unavailable for purchased. Earlier versions of CCM create shared-resource SLB instances by default. Solution: upgrade the CCM. |
