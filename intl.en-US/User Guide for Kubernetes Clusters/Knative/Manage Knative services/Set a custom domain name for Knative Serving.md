# Set a custom domain name for Knative Serving

This topic describes how to set a custom domain name for Knative Serving.

-   A domain name is registered. For more information, see [Alibaba Cloud Domains](/intl.en-US/Product Introduction/What is Alibaba Cloud Domains?.md).
-   Knative is deployed in your Container Service for Kubernetes \(ACK\) cluster. For more information, see [t423002.md\#](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Knative/Manage Knative components/Deploy Knative.md).

Knative Serving uses the default domain name `example.com` in a route. The default format of a fully qualified domain name for a Knative Serving route is `{route}.{namespace}.{default-domain}`.

## Use kubectl to modify a domain name

The following example demonstrates how to change the default domain name to a custom one in the knative-serving namespace.

1.  [Use kubectl to connect to an ACK cluster](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Cluster/Access clusters/Use kubectl to connect to an ACK cluster.md).

2.  Run the following command to modify the ConfigMap named config-domain.

    ```
    kubectl edit cm config-domain --namespace knative-serving
    ```

3.  Modify the ConfigMap.

    Replace example.com with the custom domain name that you want to use, and save the configuration. In this example, a custom domain name mydomain.com is used.

    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      mydomain.com: ""
    kind: ConfigMap
    [...]
    ```


## Deploy a Knative Service

If you have deployed a Knative Service, Knative automatically updates all Knative Services and routes based on the ConfigMap.

1.  Deploy a Knative Service. In this example, a Knative Service named helloworld-go is deployed. For more information, see [Create a Knative Service](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Knative/Manage Knative services/Create a Knative Service.md).

2.  View the deployment result.

    -   For Knative 0.7, run the following command to query the domain name of the Knative Service:

        ```
        kubectl get route ${SVC_NAME} --output jsonpath="{.status.url}"| awk -F/ '{print $3}'`
        ```

    -   For Knative 0.6, run the following command to query the domain name of the Knative Service:

        ```
        kubectl get route helloworld-go --output jsonpath="{.status.domain}"
        ```

    If the following output is returned, it indicates that the custom domain name is applied:

    ```
    helloworld-go.default.mydomain.com
    ```


## Map the custom domain name to the Knative Service

1.  Log on to the [Container Service for Kubernetes \(ACK\) console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**.

3.  On the Clusters page, find the cluster that you want to manage and click the name of the cluster or click **Details** in the **Actions** column. The details page of the cluster appears.

4.  In the left-side navigation pane of the details page, choose **Applications** \> **Knative**.

5.  On the Services tab, click the name of the Service.

    In the **Basic Information** section, you can view information about the access gateway and domain name.

6.  Add the IP address of the gateway to the resolution settings of the custom domain name in the Alibaba Cloud DNS console.


Run the following command to query the result:

```
curl http://helloworld-go.default.mydomain.com
```
