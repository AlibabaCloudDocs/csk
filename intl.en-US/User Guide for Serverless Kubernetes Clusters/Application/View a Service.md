# View a Service

If you create an application that provides external services, Kubernetes Dashboard automatically creates a LoadBalancer Service that uses a Server Load Balancer \(SLB\) instance. This allows you to direct external access to pods inside the cluster. This topic describes how to view a Service in the Container Service for Kubernetes \(ACK\) console.

1.  Log on to the [Container Service for Kubernetes \(ACK\) console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**.

3.  On the Clusters page, click the name of a cluster or click **Details** in the **Actions** column.

4.  In the left-side navigation pane of the details page, choose **Services and Ingresses** \> **Services**.

5.  On the **Services** page, you can view the Services that are created in the cluster.

    You can view information about a Service, such as the name, type, creation time, cluster IP address, and external endpoint.
