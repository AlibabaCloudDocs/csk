# Delete an ASK cluster

This topic describes how to delete a serverless Kubernetes \(ASK\) cluster in the Container Service for Kubernetes \(ACK\) console.

1.  Log on to the [Container Service for Kubernetes \(ACK\) console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Serverless Clusters**.

3.  On the Clusters page, find the cluster that you want to delete and choose **More** \> **Delete** in the Actions column.

4.  In the Delete Cluster dialog box, read and select **I understand the above information and want to delete the specified cluster**, and then click **OK**.

    **Note:** If you have deployed elastic container instances \(ECIs\) to run pods in the cluster, you must go to the **Deployments** page and delete all pods that run on the ECIs. Then perform the preceding steps to delete the ASK cluster.
