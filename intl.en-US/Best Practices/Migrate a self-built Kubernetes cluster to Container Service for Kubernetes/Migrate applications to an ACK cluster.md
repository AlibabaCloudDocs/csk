# Migrate applications to an ACK cluster

This topic describes how to use Velero and restic to migrate cloud-native applications and data on persistent volumes \(PVs\) from a self-managed Kubernetes cluster to a Container Service for Kubernetes \(ACK\) cluster. You can also use Velero and restic to migrate applications and data on PVs from a Kubernetes cluster that is managed by a third-party cloud provider to an ACK cluster.

In most cases, a self-managed Kubernetes cluster is deployed in a data center and container images are stored in a self-managed image repository. Before you migrate applications, you must migrate the container images to Alibaba Cloud Container Registry \(ACR\). For more information, see [Use image-syncer to migrate container images](/intl.en-US/Best Practices/Migrate a self-built Kubernetes cluster to Container Service for Kubernetes/Migrate container images/Use image-syncer to migrate container images.md).

In this example, a WordPress application that uses the following container images is used as an example:

```
registry.api.paas.com:5000/admin/wordpress:latest
registry.api.paas.com:5000/admin/mysql:8
```

The following code block shows the addresses of the images after migration:

```
registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/ack-migration/wordpress:latest
registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/ack-migration/mysql:8
```

In this example, the WordPress application is migrated from a self-managed Kubernetes cluster to an ACK cluster. The WordPress application consists of two components: WordPress and MySQL. Each component uses a Network File System \(NFS\) PV to store application data. The WordPress application provides services of the NodePort type.

## Procedure

1.  [Set up the environment](#section_sxm_2d9_ozp)
2.  [Back up the application in the self-managed Kubernetes cluster](#section_u5c_g0l_kij)
3.  [Restore the application in the ACK cluster](#section_9yk_jhw_mti)
4.  [Update application configurations](#section_0n4_819_ijz)
5.  [Debug and start the application.](#section_wcx_fog_7hy)

## Set up the environment

Perform the following steps to deploy Velero in the ACK cluster and the self-managed Kubernetes cluster:

**Note:** You must deploy both the Velero client and the Velero server.

1.  Install the Velero client.

    Download [Velero](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/releases). Run the following command to install Velero and verify the result:

    ```
    curl -o /usr/bin/velero https://public-bucket-1.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/velero && chmod +x /usr/bin/velero 
    ```

2.  Create an Object Storage Service \(OSS\) bucket. For more information, see [Create buckets](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/OSS console/Create buckets.md).

    You must first create an OSS bucket to store data of the application and PVs. We recommend that you create an OSS bucket for each self-managed Kubernetes cluster.

    1.  Log on to the [OSS console](https://oss.console.aliyun.com/).

    2.  On the **Overview** page, click **Create Bucket** on the right side. You can also click the Create icon \(+\) next to Storage Capacity on the left side.

    3.  In the Create Bucket panel, set parameters for the bucket.

        In this example, the OSS bucket is named `ls-velero` and deployed in the China \(Hangzhou\) region.

3.  Create a Resource Access Management \(RAM\) user and generate an AccessKey pair. For more information, see [Create a RAM user](/intl.en-US/RAM User Management/Basic operations/Create a RAM user.md).

    If you use the AccessKey pair of an Alibaba Cloud account, skip this step.

    ```
    {
        "Version": "1",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Action": [
                    "ecs:DescribeSnapshots",
                    "ecs:CreateSnapshot",
                    "ecs:DeleteSnapshot",
                    "ecs:DescribeDisks",
                    "ecs:CreateDisk",
                    "ecs:Addtags",
                    "oss:PutObject",
                    "oss:GetObject",
                    "oss:DeleteObject",
                    "oss:GetBucket",
                    "oss:ListObjects"
                ],
                "Resource": [
                    "*"
                ],
                "Effect": "Allow"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

4.  Deploy the Velero server.

    1.  Add the AccessKey pair generated in [Step 3](#step_1et_49b_ow4) to the credentials-velero deployment file of Velero.

        ```
        ALIBABA_CLOUD_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<access_key_id>
        ALIBABA_CLOUD_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET=<access_key_secret>
        ```

    2.  Run the following command to deploy Velero:

        ```
        velero install --provider alibabacloud --image registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/haoshuwei24/velero:v1.2.0 --bucket ls-velero --secret-file ./credentials-velero --use-volume-snapshots=false --backup-location-config region=cn-hangzhou --use-restic --plugins registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/acs/velero-plugin-alibabacloud:v1.2 --wait
        ```

    Run the following command to query the pod status:

    ```
    kubectl -n velero get po
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```
    NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    restic-fqwsc              1/1     Running   0          41s
    restic-kfzqt              1/1     Running   0          41s

    restic-ql2kr              1/1     Running   0          41s
    restic-qrsrn              1/1     Running   0          41s
    restic-srjmm              1/1     Running   0          41s
    velero-67b975f5cb-68nj4   1/1     Running   0          41s
    ```


## Back up the application in the self-managed Kubernetes cluster

-   If you want to back up only the WordPress application, run the following command:

    ```
    velero backup create wordpress-backup-without-pv --include-namespaces wordpress
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```
    Backup request "wordpress-backup-without-pv" submitted successfully.
    Run `velero backup describe wordpress-backup-without-pv` or `velero backup logs wordpress-backup-without-pv` for more details.
    ```

    Run the following command to back up the application:

    ```
    velero backup get
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```
    NAME                          STATUS      CREATED                         EXPIRES   STORAGE LOCATION   SELECTOR
    wordpress-backup-without-pv   Completed   2019-12-12 14:08:24 +0800 CST   29d       default            <none>
    ```

-   If you want to back up the data of the WordPress application and PVs, run the following commands:
    1.  ```
# Annotate the pods to which PVs are attached. In this example, the WordPress application runs on the wordpress-7cf5849f47-mbvx4 and mysql-74dddbdcc8-h2tls pods.
kubectl -n wordpress annotate pod/wordpress-7cf5849f47-mbvx4 backup.velero.io/backup-volumes=wordpress-persistent-storage
pod/wordpress-7cf5849f47-mbvx4 annotated
```

    2.  ```
# The PV attached to the wordpress-7cf5849f47-mbvx4 pod is mysql-persistent-storage. The PV attached to the mysql-74dddbdcc8-h2tls pod is wordpress-persistent-storage. Run the following commands to annotate the pods:
kubectl -n wordpress annotate pod/mysql-74dddbdcc8-h2tls backup.velero.io/backup-volumes=mysql-persistent-storage
pod/mysql-74dddbdcc8-h2tls annotated
```

    3.  ```
# Back up the WordPress application.
velero backup create wordpress-backup-with-pv --include-namespaces wordpress
```

        Expected output:

        ```
        Backup request "wordpress-backup-with-pv" submitted successfully.
        Run `velero backup describe wordpress-backup-with-pv` or `velero backup logs wordpress-backup-with-pv` for more details.
        ```

    4.  ```
velero backup get
```

        Expected output:

        ```
        NAME                          STATUS      CREATED                         EXPIRES   STORAGE LOCATION   SELECTOR
        wordpress-backup-with-pv      Completed   2019-12-12 14:23:40 +0800 CST   29d       default            <none>
        wordpress-backup-without-pv   Completed   2019-12-12 14:08:24 +0800 CST   29d       default            <none>
        ```


In the [OSS console](https://oss.console.aliyun.com/), you can view the files that have been backed up in the OSS bucket.

## Restore the application in the ACK cluster

In the self-managed Kubernetes cluster, the WordPress application uses NFS PVs. In the ACK cluster, you can configure Apsara File Storage NAS volumes to store data of the WordPress application. In this example, a StorageClass named nfs is created for the WordPress application, and Alibaba Cloud SSDs are used as backend storage.

The CSI plug-in is used in this example. For more information, see [Provision Alibaba Cloud disks as dynamic PVs](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Storage management-CSI/Disk volumes/Provision Alibaba Cloud disks as dynamic PVs.md).

1.  Create a StorageClass.

    If you back up only the WordPress application, skip this step.

    ```
    cat nfs.yaml
    ```

    The following code block shows a sample template:

    ```
    # Output
    apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
    kind: StorageClass
    metadata:
       name: nfs
    provisioner: diskplugin.csi.alibabacloud.com
    parameters:
        type: cloud_ssd
    reclaimPolicy: Retain
    ```

    Run the following command to deploy the application:

    ```
    kubectl apply -f nfs.yaml
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```
    storageclass.storage.k8s.io/nfs created
    ```

2.  Restore the WordPress application.

    Use Velero to restore the WordPress application in the ACK cluster. This completes the migration process.

    ```
    velero restore create --from-backup wordpress-backup-with-pv
    velero restore get
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```
    NAME                                      BACKUP                     STATUS       WARNINGS   ERRORS   CREATED                         SELECTOR
    wordpress-backup-with-pv-20191212152745   wordpress-backup-with-pv   InProgress   0          0        2019-12-12 15:27:45 +0800 CST   <none>
    ```

    Run the following command to check the status of the WordPress application. An error is returned to indicate that the container images cannot be pulled.

    ```
    $ kubectl -n wordpress get po
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```
    NAME                         READY   STATUS         RESTARTS   AGE
    mysql-669b4666cd-trsnz       0/1     ErrImagePull   0          19m
    mysql-74dddbdcc8-h2tls       0/1     Init:0/1       0          19m
    wordpress-7cf5849f47-mbvx4   0/1     Init:0/1       0          19m
    wordpress-bb5d74d95-xcjxw    0/1     ErrImagePull   0          19m
    ```


## Update application configurations

Application configurations include the image address, service exposure method, and the mount point of the storage disks used by the application. In this example, only the image address is updated.

1.  Log on to the [Container Service for Kubernetes \(ACK\) console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, Choose **Applications** \> **Deployments**. Select the cluster and namespace to which the application is migrated.

3.  Find the WordPress application, and choose **More** \> **View in Yaml** in the **Actions** column.

4.  In the Edit YAML dialog box, change the `image` field to the address of the application image after migration and click **Update**.

    **Note:** You can obtain the address of the application image after migration from the Prerequisites section in this topic.

    Run the following command to check the status of the WordPress application:

    ```
    kubectl -n wordpress get po
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```
    NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    mysql-678b5d8499-vckfd       1/1     Running   0          100s
    wordpress-8566f5f7d8-7shk6   1/1     Running   0          3m18s
    ```


## Debug and start the application.

The WordPress application consists of the WordPress and MySQL components. Each component uses an NFS PV to store application data. The WordPress application provides services of the NodePort type. You can use the following YAML file to debug and start the application:

```
# 1. Create a StorageClass named nfs.
cat nfs-sc.yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: nfs
provisioner: helm.default/nfs
reclaimPolicy: Delete
kubectl apply -f  nfs-sc.yaml

# 2. Create a Secret to store the password of the MySQL component. For example, if the password is mysql, run the echo -n "mysql" |base64 command to query the Base64-encoded string of the password.
cat secret.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql
