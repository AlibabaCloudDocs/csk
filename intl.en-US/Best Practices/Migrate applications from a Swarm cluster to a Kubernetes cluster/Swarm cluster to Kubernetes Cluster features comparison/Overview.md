# Overview

This topic describes the prerequisites and limits that are used to compare clusters of Container Service for Swarm and clusters of Container Service for Kubernetes \(ACK\).

## Prerequisites

An ACK cluster is created. For more information, see [t16639.md\#](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Cluster management/Create Kubernetes clusters/Create a dedicated Kubernetes cluster.md).

**Note:**

-   ACK provides the following types of clusters: the dedicated Kubernetes cluster, the managed Kubernetes cluster, the multi-zone Kubernetes cluster, and the serverless Kubernetes \(ASK\) cluster \(in public preview\).
-   In this topic, an application is created in a Swarm and an ACK cluster to compare the features of Swarm and ACK clusters.

## Limits

In this topic, the features of Swarm and Kubernetes clusters are compared based on the following limits:

-   Both applications are stateless.
-   Application data is stored in databases or volumes.
