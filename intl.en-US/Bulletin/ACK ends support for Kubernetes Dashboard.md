# ACK ends support for Kubernetes Dashboard

Container Service for Kubernetes \(ACK\) clusters with Kubernetes 1.18 or later versions no longer support Kubernetes Dashboard. To use Kubernetes Dashboard, we recommended that you deploy the kubernetes-dashboard application on the App Catalog page. Log on to the [ACK console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com/#/k8s/catalog/detail/incubator_kubernetes-dashboard) to deploy kubernetes-dashboard.
