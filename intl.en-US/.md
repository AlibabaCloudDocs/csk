# Billing

Container Service for Kubernetes \(ACK\) provides multiple cluster types. The billable items and billing rules vary by cluster type. This topic describes the billable items and billing rules of ACK.

## Billable items

-   **Cluster management**: ACK clusters are integrated with the capabilities of Alibaba Cloud in virtualization, storage, networking, and security. This allows ACK clusters to provide high-performance and scalable management of containerized applications. This also simplifies the operations required to create or scale clusters and allows you to focus on the development and management of containerized applications. Therefore, the cluster management fees of different cluster types are different. For more information, see [Billing of cluster management](#section_3zb_7a9_asx).
-   **Cloud services**: You are charged for the Alibaba Cloud services that are used by ACK clusters. For more information, see [Billing of cloud services](#section_zh6_gtx_mj7).

## Billing of cluster management

ACK provides the following cluster types: managed Kubernetes clusters, dedicated Kubernetes clusters, serverless Kubernetes \(ASK\) clusters, edge Kubernetes clusters, and registered Kubernetes clusters. Managed Kubernetes clusters include standard managed Kubernetes clusters and professional managed Kubernetes clusters. Edge Kubernetes clusters include standard edge Kubernetes clusters and professional edge Kubernetes clusters. The following table describes the billing rules for the management of different cluster types.

|Cluster type|Description|Billing rule|

## Billing of professional Kubernetes clusters

-   **Bills**

    The billing cycle of a professional Kubernetes cluster is 1 hour. You can view the billing details of the previous hour in the ACK console. The service fee is automatically deducted from your Alibaba Cloud account. A bill is issued within 10 to 30 minutes after the current billing cycle ends.

-   **Overdue payments**

    If your Alibaba Cloud account does not have a sufficient balance, the payment for the professional Kubernetes cluster becomes overdue. In this case, you cannot access the API server of the cluster. However, services that run on nodes are not affected. Your professional Kubernetes cluster is suspended if you do not top up your account within 15 days after a payment becomes overdue. In this case, the nodes are removed from your cluster and the cluster is deleted, but the nodes are not released. However, the containers released due to cluster deletion cannot be restored.
