# Limits

This topic describes the limits that apply when you use clusters of Container Service for Kubernetes \(ACK\).

## Overview

-   After an ACK cluster is created, the following limits apply:
    -   You cannot change the virtual private cloud \(VPC\).
    -   You cannot change the cluster type. For example, you cannot change a dedicated Kubernetes cluster to a managed Kubernetes cluster.
    -   You cannot change the network plug-in.
    -   You cannot change the volume plug-in.
-   You cannot migrate applications across namespaces.
-   Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) instances support both the pay-as-you-go and subscription billing methods. You can change the billing method of ECS instances from pay-as-you-go to subscription in the ECS console. Other resources, such as Server Load Balancer \(SLB\) instances, support only the pay-as-you-go billing method.
-   Operations such as cluster creation, expansion, and auto scaling are subject to resource quota limits and inventory availability. You may fail to create nodes if the resource quota or inventory is insufficient.
-   If you want to create subscription instances when you create a cluster, instance creation may fail due to resource quota limits and inventory availability. After a subscription instance is created, you cannot release it before the subscription expires. To avoid these issues, we recommend that you create pay-as-you-go instances when you create a cluster. You can change the billing method from pay-as-you-go to subscription in the ECS console if necessary.
-   ECS instance specifications: more than 1 cores and larger than 2 GiB of memory.
